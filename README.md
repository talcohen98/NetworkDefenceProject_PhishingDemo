# Spear Phishing Demo Project

This project is an educational tool designed to demonstrate how personalized spear phishing messages can be generated using user-provided data. The system leverages OpenAI's GPT API to create convincing phishing messages that exploit personal information to appear authentic and relevant to the targeted individual.

## Project Components

### 1. **Flask Application (`app.py`)**
   - The core of the project, the Flask app, orchestrates the entire process from collecting user data to generating and displaying the spear phishing message.
   - **Routes:**
     - `/` - Introductory page explaining the purpose of the demo.
     - `/form` - Page where users input their LinkedIn-like data to simulate the phishing process.
     - `/display` - Displays the generated spear phishing message in a format resembling an email or social media message.
     - `/after-message` - Warning page educating users about the dangers of interacting with phishing content.
     - `/final` - Concluding page providing additional insights into spear phishing attacks.

### 2. **Message Generation (`MessageGenarator.py`)**
   - This script handles the interaction with the OpenAI GPT API to generate personalized spear phishing messages based on the data collected from the user.
   - **Process:**
     - The script takes the user's input (name, education, interests, and LinkedIn posts) and constructs a prompt designed to elicit a realistic phishing message from the GPT model.
     - It integrates a pre-defined malicious link and other phishing elements into the message.
     - The final output is a message tailored to the user's data, presented as if from a credible source.

### 3. **HTML Templates**
   - **`intro.html`**: A welcoming page that introduces users to the spear phishing demo and its educational goals.
   - **`index.html`**: The input form where users provide their details for message generation.
   - **`display.html`**: A formatted page that displays the generated phishing message, mimicking an email or social media message.
   - **`after_message.html`**: A warning page that users see after interacting with the phishing message, aimed at reinforcing the dangers of phishing.
   - **`final.html`**: The final page that wraps up the demo, providing key takeaways and additional information on spear phishing.

## System Flow

1. **Introduction**: The user is greeted with an overview of the demo, setting the context for what they will experience.
2. **Data Collection**: The user inputs personal details and recent social media-like posts, simulating data that attackers could gather from platforms like LinkedIn.
3. **Message Generation**: The system uses the provided data to create a highly personalized phishing message using the GPT API.
4. **Message Display**: The phishing message is displayed to the user, illustrating how realistic such attacks can be.
5. **Warning and Education**: The user is then shown a warning and provided with tips on how to recognize and avoid falling victim to similar phishing attempts in the real world.

## Communication with GPT API

- **Integration**: The system integrates with the OpenAI GPT API through the `MessageGenarator.py` script.
- **Prompt Engineering**: The script carefully constructs prompts that guide the GPT model to generate phishing messages that are both personalized and contextually appropriate based on user-provided data.
- **API Interaction**: 
  - The system retrieves API keys and other necessary credentials from environment variables to securely communicate with the GPT API.
  - Messages are generated by passing the user data and crafted prompts to the GPT model, which returns the finalized phishing message.
- **Customization**: The system is configured to ensure that the output message is complete, with all fields filled in, mimicking the realistic approach that a phishing attacker might take.
